As the name implies this idea involves the player navigating through a track full of twists and turns within a certain time limit. The user would be playing from a birdâ€™s eye point of view. Another feature of the game would be to have small obstacles on the track and also have the camera change to a different part of the track when the player goes off screen. A possible addition could be a minimap to view the whole track. This game will be created through the use of the Slick2D Java 2D game design library. Slick2D is an open source 2D Java Game Library, which utilizes tools from the Lightweight Java Games Library in order to make 2D game development easier. We essentially used Slick2D because our main demo application is a 2D game, and we wanted to create that 2D game using a convenient and easy toolset. Slick2D includes support for images, animations, particles, sounds, music and much much more. Additionally there are many community based projects that add additional functionality such as entity support, theme-able widgets and box2d wrappers.
